# Advent of Code 2018 - Go

I've decided I want to learn how to program in Go! Typically, I would go through some Project Euler problems in order to teach myself the basics, but with it being the beginning of December I decided to go through the Advent of Code to help teach me. These solutions are not designed to be the most efficient the first time around, but more about learning the basics. As I learn more I will try to make each solution faster.

## Getting Started

This project has two main directories, "Inputs" and "Solutions". I initially tried to set the solutions to read the inputs from the website, but it would only tell me to log in to get the input. If you want to use this code to solve some Advent of Code problems, put your own inputs into the "Inputs" directory and run the solutions from the "Solutions" directory.

### Prerequisites

So far, the only prerequisites to run these solutions is to have Go installed on your computer. If I use any non-standard libraries later I will list them here.
